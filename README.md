# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project we learned the basics of SQL and utilized an application called PGAdmin to merge data from multiple spreadsheets and create, and export a spreadsheet that focused our merged and filtered data.  As data analysts we will often be given multiple files with pieces of data that are useful for a project we are working on.  SQL and PGAdmin gives us the ability to merge pieces of different files, and create new sheets of data sourced from multiple files. 

## Results

### Deliverable 1, Employees Retiring by Title

In three blocks of code we were able to create and filter tables to find exactly what we needed. In the first block we created a table 'challenge_table'.  

![challenge_code](webaddress)

This resulted in extraneous data, we had names of employees who worked in multple positions, we filtered this data with a function called 'Distinct On' and filtered out employees who were no longer with the comppany.  This cleaned our data and we created another table called 'unique_titles' 

![unique_titles](webaddress)

The final step in the first deliverable was to use SQL code to sum the totals of each job title.

![title_count](webaddress)
![title_chart](webaddress)

* Most of the employees eligible for retiring are in Senior positions. Over 50,000 Senior Level position will be opening up.
* Only 2 Managers will be eligible for retirment.  Why have older employees remained in Senior level positions as opposed to moving into management.

### Deliverable 2, Employees Eligible for Mentorship Program
